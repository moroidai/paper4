Indonesia, as one of the leading countries in the third world, has been gathering attentions because of its great potential as a fast-growing and large country. In this paper, I use the data collected by the Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) in 1997, which is part of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Project in the U.S. This paper aims to give some insights into public policies to improve the situation of developing countries by analyzing data. All the data manupulation and analysis in this paper have been done in a reproducible way.
